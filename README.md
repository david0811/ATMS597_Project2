# ATMS597_Project2

## Creating climate stripes

This project creates a climate stripes figure similar to the method described by
Edward Hawkins.

The user inputs the desired location, along with the key to access the data, and the program
will take care of the data cleaning and plotting for you.

You can access the data using this website 
[GHCND Dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn)

After signing up for the token, simply add it to the climostripe.py script and you are good to go.

Make sure to check out example notebook provided.
